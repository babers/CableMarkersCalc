# CableMarkersCalc
This is a small Dot Net application which is used to calculate occurrences of numerals within a specified integer range. This is required in order to purchase specific quantities of cable markers used for numbering video,audio,network cables. Without this type of utility program it is extremely hard to make an estimate. This program simplies this process and once can easily decide, how many 0s or 1s or 2s or required to be purchased.
